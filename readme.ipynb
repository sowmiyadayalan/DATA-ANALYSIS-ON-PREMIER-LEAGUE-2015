    "### Analysis Performed\n",
    "Let us start by analyse every team's performance in Premier League 2015\n",
    "### Analysis 1:\n",
    "- Build a league Table containing points details of all teams who played in Premier League\n",
    "- Analyze all team's performance in both home and away matches\n",
    "#### STEPS:\n",
    "    * Three empty dataframes are created(match_details_dataframe,home_match_dataframe,away_match_dataframe). All these dataframes will contain team name, number of matches played, number of won, number lost ,number of draw,total number team goals,total number of oponent team goals\n",
    "    * All JSON files for every match is read one by one.\n",
    "    * Once a JSON file is loaded, Check if home team name is already available in dataframe. \n",
    "        * If yes then that recorder is retrieved and their  match count is incremented  by one. \n",
    "        * if home team goal is higher than away team goal then value in win column is incremented by 1. else if home team goal is equal to away team goal, then value in draw is incremented by one. else home team goal is lesser than away team goal, then value of loss is incremented by one. \n",
    "        * For goals and opponent goal values are incremented based on the values mentioned in the file.\n",
    "    * Similar updates are made for away team. \n",
    "    * Two new columns \"Goal Difference\" and \"points\" are included in the dataframe. \n",
    "    * Goal Diifference = For Goals - Away Goals\n",
    "    * Points = (number of matches won * 3) + (number of matches draw * 1) + (number of matches lost * 0)\n",
    "    * League table is sorted based on points, goal difference, for goals. If there are two teams with same rank in ythe league table even after considering all these three criteria, according to match rules, these two teams will play again. \n",
    "##### OVERALL LEAGUE TABLE\n",
    "![overallLeagueTable](Pictures/overallLeagueTable.png)\n",
    "    * Similarly Home matches league Table and Away matches league table is crested\n",
    "##### HOME LEAGUE TABLE    \n",
    "![homeLeagueTable](Pictures/homeLeagueTable.png)\n",
    "##### AWAY LEAGUE TABLE\n",

    "* All teams in general have scored higher points in home ground games compared to away games. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Analysis 2:\n",
    "- Identify if weather affects a team's performance\n",
    "#### STEPS:\n",
    "    * For this analysis the consolidated dataframe with every match details, weather and location details is considered\n",
    "![matchwithWeatherDetails](Pictures/matchwithWeatherDetails.png)\n",
    "    * Unique list of weather conditions are identified. I noticed that there were few redundant entries like 'Light rain shower' and 'Light rain'. All such entries have been combined into a single weather type \n",
    "    * After combining, We have 12 weather types, 'Cloudy', 'Sunny', 'Light rain shower', 'Heavy rain shower',\n",
    "       'Moderate rain shower', 'Light drizzle', 'Light snow showers',\n",
    "       'Heavy rain', 'Thundery outbreaks possible', 'Light sleet showers',\n",
    "       'Light snow', 'Heavy snow showers'\n",
    "    * ipywidgets is used to create dropdown box containing all these weather types\n",
    "    * once a weather type is selected, a copy of original dataframe is obtained and the dataframe is filtered to contain matches for the selected weather type\n",
    "    * Based on this filtered dataframe, a new dataframe (df_team_match_details) containing match count, number of matches won, number of matches lost, number of matches drawn, for-goals, away-goals, points scored is created. \n",
    "    * A barh plot is created with total points in x-axis and team names in y-axis\n",
    "![Analysis2_all](Pictures/Analysis2_all.png)    \n",
    "    * Black dots represents the total number of matches played\n",
    "#### Analysis:\n",
    "- Let us analyse how teams play in worst weather conditions(Heavy rain and snow)\n",
    "HEAVY RAIN AND HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS\n",
    "\n",
    "![heavyRain](Pictures/heavyRain.png)  \n",
    "![snow.png](Pictures/snow.png)  \n",
    "- We can see than from heavy rain condition, watford has not performed well(Lost all their 3 matches under heavy rain).\n",
    "- On the other hand Manchester United have played consistently under all weather conditions\n",
    "### Analysis 3:\n",
    "- Perform head2head performance analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEPS:\n",
    "    * For this analysis, all head2head JSON files for any two teams combination is read.\n",
    "    * The datadet contains head2head details of last 50 matches\n",
    "    * Collected number of matches won,lost and draw\n",
    "![head2headmatchDetails](Pictures/head2headmatchDetails.png)      \n",
    "    * Using ipywidgets, two dropdown boxes have been created. These boxes will contain unique list of team names. \n",
    "    * When a selection is made, a copy of the data frame is created\n",
    "    * Based on the selection from these two boxes, the dataframe copy is searched to get the required row \n",
    "    * When two teams are selected, these values can be available in either team1 column or team 2 column. Hence while searching for the required row, both column 1 and column 2 is search for team1 dropdown and team2 dropdown. For example, If Chelsea is selected in team1 dropdown, occurance of chelsea is checked in both columns\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Analysis:\n",
    "Let us findout the head2head performace between the top 2 teams,\n",
    "![LesterCityvsArsenal](Pictures/LesterCityvsArsenal.png) \n",
